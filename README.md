## git pull requests

We will use this repo to demonstrate how pull requests work with git and GitHub. The following steps layout explain the process.

1. Fork a repo
2. Clone a repo
3. Make changes to the repo 
4. push the repo to your GitHub account
5. Make a pull request

## Integrating pull requests

GitHub will run a series of checks to make sure the code can be merged into the main branch. If everything goes well your collaborators will integrate your changes into the code base (hopefully). A few things that might slow down the process are merge conflicts or potential errors in the code. 

To ensure your changes are merged it is best to write a meaningful message when making your pull request. Explain the changes you've made and why they should be merged. Explain any potential problems that may arise due to these changes. If the codebase includes testing be certain that the code in your repo passes the automating testing, or if new functionality is to be merged be sure to include your own tests.
